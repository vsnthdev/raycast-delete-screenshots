This is a [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) [plugin](https://www.raycast.com/store) that gives a handy `Delete screenshots` command in your Raycast. So, you can quickly get rid of all your screenshots.

## 💡 Why did I build this?

I work with AI a lot while vibe coding for my work projects, where I constantly take hundreds of screenshots to show AI how things look. It quickly became hard to always pick the right screenshot when I had lots of them that looked similar. So, frequent cleanup of screenshots was required, but there were too many steps involved in deleting screenshots. I built this Raycast plugin to delete all screenshots in a single go, super fast 👌
